# uBitx_Nextion
This PCBA cleans up the wiring for V3-V5 uBitx Radio Kits that use the Nextion Display

Key features are:

 - [KB8CEC](https://github.com/phdlee) signal level meter and DSP functions are incorporated.
 - Anti-pop circuit was added to reduce the magnitude of key-clicks
 - Additional power supply filtering reduces background audio noise
 - Convenient points of connection for the Nextion display
 - Intermediate connections reduce wire harness
